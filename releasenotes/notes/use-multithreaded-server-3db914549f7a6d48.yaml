features:
  - |
    Replace ``WSGIAsyncServer`` with ``dwave.cloud.auth.server.BackgroundAppServer``,
    a more robust and stable multi-threaded server.
    By using a multi-threaded server we improve the visualizer app load time,
    as browsers can download static files and make API requests in parallel now.
    See `#165 <https://github.com/dwavesystems/dwave-inspector/issues/165>`_.
upgrade:
  - |
    Minimal version of ``dwave-cloud-client`` required is now 0.11.0 to
    support `#165 <https://github.com/dwavesystems/dwave-inspector/issues/165>`_
    and fix `#164 <https://github.com/dwavesystems/dwave-inspector/issues/164>`_.
