features:
  - |
    Render inspector inline in Jupyter notebooks.
    See `#109 <https://github.com/dwavesystems/dwave-inspector/issues/109>`_
    and `#133 <https://github.com/dwavesystems/dwave-inspector/issues/133>`_.
fixes:
  - |
    Make ``show()`` non-blocking regardless of the ``block`` argument when
    no viewer manages to open the inspector page.
    See `#139 <https://github.com/dwavesystems/dwave-inspector/issues/139>`_.
upgrade:
  - |
    Custom viewer can now return ``False`` to signal a non-blocking ``show()``
    behavior is desired. Previously the value returned was ignored by the
    caller.
