    The ``.show()`` call does not return a ``RichDisplayURL`` anymore. Instead,
    we reverted to returning URL in a plain ``str``. Jupyter viewer will display
    the inspector inline if possible, otherwise the URL is opened in a browser.

    To render the inspector URL inline in a Jupyter notebook cell, independently
    of the ``.show()`` call, you can do::

      url = dwave.inspector.show(...)
      ...
      from dwave.inspector.utils import RichDisplayURL
      RichDisplayURL(url)

fixes:
  - |
    Fix duplicated inline render of the Inspector in GUI Jupyter in case when
    the returned (rich URL) object is displayed in the same cell the
    ``dwave.inspector.show()`` was called.
    See `#152 <https://github.com/dwavesystems/dwave-inspector/issues/152>`_
