fixes:
  - |
    Improve performance of the inspector server by postprocessing solver data
    inplace, saving one deep copy of solver metadata (~600kB for Advantage) on
    each API request of solver data.

features:
  - |
    Replace builtin JSON encoder with ``orjson``, achieving 2-5x speed-up of
    problem and solver API endpoints.

upgrade:
  - |
    ``dwave.inspector.utils.NumpyJSONProvider`` is removed and no longer available.
    Use ``orjson.dumps`` with ``option=orjson.OPT_SERIALIZE_NUMPY`` instead.
